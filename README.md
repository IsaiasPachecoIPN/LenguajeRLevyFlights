## Levy Flights distribution with R

This R program visualizes the Levy distribution that appears in blue whale movements in the Northeast Pacific [Dataset](https://datarepository.movebank.org/entities/datapackage/b7853a1e-43fc-483d-906a-6991ec676413). The program uses data from the Argos satellite tracking system to calculate the distances between consecutive whale locations. It then uses the stabledist package to generate a Levy distribution and plots it along with the histogram of whale distances.

The program demonstrates that the distances between consecutive whale locations follow a Levy distribution. This suggests that blue whales use a Levy flight search strategy when foraging for food.
